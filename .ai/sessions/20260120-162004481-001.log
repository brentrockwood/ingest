Proxmox Network Misconfiguration / Locked Out\n\n**Symptom**:\n- Web UI at `https://10.1.2.3:8006` is unreachable.\n- Maybe web UI at `https://10.1.1.29:8006` is also unreachable.\n- I was recently editing `/etc/network/interfaces`.\n\n**Goal**:  \nRegain access to `box1` without physical console if possible.\n\n### 2.1 Known-Good Network Intent\n\n- Proxmox host: `box1`\n- 1G bridge: `vmbr0`\n  - Ports: `nic0`\n  - IP: `10.1.1.29/24`\n  - Gateway: `10.1.1.1` (unless I\u2019ve purposely moved the gateway)\n- 10G bridge: `vmbr1`\n  - Ports: `enp4s0`\n  - IP: `10.1.2.3/24`\n  - Initially **no gateway**; later may use `10.1.2.1`.\n\n### 2.2 Recovery Steps\n\n1. **Try both IPs** from `ws5` or another machine:\n   - `https://10.1.2.3:8006` (10G)\n   - `https://10.1.1.29:8006` (1G)\n   - If one works, log in and fix `/etc/network/interfaces` via GUI or shell.\n\n2. **SSH access**:\n   - Try `ssh root@10.1.2.3`\n   - Try `ssh root@10.1.1.29`\n\n------------------------------\nResult 2 (Source: ../network-docs/WARP.md):\n### Critical Failure Modes\n\n**10G Switch Uplink Issues** (most common):\n- Symptom: Core devices (Proxmox, NAS, workstation) can't reach router/internet\n- Cause: SX3008F lost running-config after power loss, uplink Port 1 reverted to incompatible settings\n- Fix: Access switch console (via `pi1` if needed), reconfigure Port 1, **save config to startup-config**\n\n**Proxmox Network Lockout**:\n- Symptom: Can't reach Proxmox web UI or SSH on either `10.1.2.3` or `10.1.1.29`\n- Cause: Misconfigured `/etc/network/interfaces`\n- Fix: Use `pi1` console access or physical console, restore known-good network config (template in `90-Runbooks.md`)\n\n### Network Conventions\n\n- All IPs are in `10.1.x.0/24` space\n- Hostnames are stable: `home`, `nas4`, `box1`, `ws5`, `pi1`, `pi5`, `bdrptr`\n- Only one default gateway per host (either `10.1.1.1` or `10.1.2.1`)\n- 10G core hosts default gateway: `10.1.2.1`\n- 1G hosts default gateway: `10.1.1.1`\n\n### Important Context\n\n------------------------------\nResult 3 (Source: ../network-docs/90-Runbooks.md):\n2. **SSH access**:\n   - Try `ssh root@10.1.2.3`\n   - Try `ssh root@10.1.1.29`\n\n3. **If both fail**:\n   - Use `pi1` or physical console to log into Proxmox shell directly.\n\n4. **Restore known-good `/etc/network/interfaces`**:\n   - Keep a copy of working config here:\n\n------------------------------", "response": "#IAmNotADoctor", "duration": 1.3111298084259033}
